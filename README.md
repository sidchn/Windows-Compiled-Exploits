# Windows-Compiled-Exploits
Since not everyone has access to Visual Studio at all times, this repository aims to have some useful compiled windows exploits/binaries that can be used while performing penetration testing. I do not take responsibility for any of the exploits nor do I own them, I would highly suggest to first test them in a Virtual Machine before actually running them against your target.


## 1. SeLoadDriverPrivilege-EoP (Elevation of Privilege)

[Checkout this post by tarlogic security](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/abusing-seloaddriverprivilege-for-privilege-escalation/)

The privilege escalation method is being demonstrated against the machine Fuse from Hack The Box.

If we have a low privilege shell with the SeLoadDriverPrivilege, and also note that this exploit no longer works since Windows 10 20H2 (Build 19042) while DV (Driver Verifier) is enabled

The following files have been uploaded to the target.

The vulnerable driver Capcom is laoded with the eopdriverloader and the exploit is then ran to execute c:\windows\temp\test\reverse.exe with system privileges.
