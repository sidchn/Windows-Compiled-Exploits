# Windows-Compiled-Exploits
Since not everyone has access to Visual Studio at all times, this repository aims to have some useful compiled windows exploits/binaries that can be used while performing penetration testing. I do not take responsibility for any of the exploits nor do I own them, I would highly suggest to first test them in a Virtual Machine before actually running them against your target.
